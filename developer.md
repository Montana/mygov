Project MyGov is a series of open source projects and is supported by the efforts of an entire community. We'd love for you to get involved. Whatever your level of skill or however much time you can spare, your contribution is greatly appreciated. Currently we only have a few public repositories as part of the [Github account for the GSA Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies](https://github.com/GSA-OCSIT). These repo's are listed below and as more open up we will highlight them here. We are also considering creating a developer focused mailing list, but in the meantime, please [sign-up for our newsletter](http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows/mygov), [follow us on twitter](http://bit.ly/mygovtwitter) or [other channels](http://presidential-innovation-fellows.github.com/mygov/contact/), and check back on this page for updates. 

## Open Source Repositories

## Ways to Contribute
As our code becomes public there are a number of ways for people to contribute. Below are just some of the general ways to participate, but we will be updating these with links and more specific pointers in the near future. 

* **Everyone** - Help expand documentation and answer questions to make it easier for other users to get started and [join relevant discussions](http://presidential-innovation-fellows.github.com/mygov/contact) to help shape the project's future.
* **Users** - Download and test the latest development version of the project and submit bug reports or feature requests.
* **Internationalization** - Contribute translations in other languages
* **Technical Folks** - Fork the development versions and submit a pull request, especially for any known issues.
