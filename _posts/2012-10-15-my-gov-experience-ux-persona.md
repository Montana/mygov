Raise your hand if you've ever seen this message on your computer screen: "FATAL ERROR: You entered the wrong address." (Or some other equally horrific text.)

Instills confidence, right?

Changing the copy, and maybe even the way it's displayed, is such an easy fix, and becomes an opportunity to create a more pleasant user experience (UX). Because really, it's never the users fault. Even if it is, it shouldn't be communicated that way. Soften it up, reposition it, and present it as:

"We can't seem to find that address. Please try entering it again."

One way to address this issue before a person even sees this type of error is to have an Experience Persona document in place. An experience persona informs what the UX looks, feels, and sounds like - and ensures that everyone, from engineers to editors, designers to developers, has a central place, a roadmap of sorts, to create unexpected delight. Because everything, from the back end code to the word choice to the button color, is an opportunity to delight people.

Early on in Project MyGov we did research at the Library of Congress and National Archives to study how the government historically communicated with people, and how people talked to the government. This was done, in part to inform the MyGov UX. (It also informed the design and UI, and Danny Chapman will cover that in another post.)

We're grateful to Eric Frazier from Library of Congress, who took the time to carefully curate our session in the Rare Books Reading Room. Artifacts such as an original Democratic Party Ticket to a document from the Colony of New Hampshire helped us understand how people communicated back then. We also looked at the old WPA posters, created under Frankline Delano Roosevelt's New Deal, were produced between 1936 to 1943.

How does this tie to MyGov? There was a bit of an a-ha moment when looking at these posters: back then, they had to get across a great deal of information in a small space. It's kind of a nice tie into today's social communications, specifically Twitter, where you also have a small space (140 characters) to tell get your point across.

We consciously say person instead of citizen whenever we can, because we realize that not everyone who interacts with the government is a citizen. We also try not to use the word users...but freely admit that old habits die hard.

Disney does a great job at this. Even when you're waiting in line (or queue, as our friends across the pond would say) for a ride, the attention to detail shines through. With the Indiana Jones ride, you spend time walking through caves that mirror the movie experience, with radios and skulls peppered throughout. It makes the time spent waiting in line somewhat interactive, putting you into the frame of mind.

All of this is embodied in a document called an Experience Persona.

The way we talk to people, the words we choose... they're important. So instead of seeing, "Date of Birth" we'll say, "When were you born?" And rather than "Home address" there's "Where do you live most of the time?" Because talking to someone how people really talk to one another is important.

It's just as important to have non-examples. So while MyGov should come across as a fresh experience, it shouldn't be trendy. Personable, but not creepy. Grounded, but not stodgy. You get the idea.
