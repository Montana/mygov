As we sat down to reimagine the way citizens interact with government, we quickly realized, that at their most basic level, many citizen services are transacted using standarized forms contained within a file known as a  [PDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format).

PDFs are a popular file format used to represent traditional, paper documents online while preserving their original, off-line formatting. PDFs ensure others cannot make changes to the original document, and as such, serve as a logical container for forms and legal documents to which accuracy is key.

Despite their widespread use, however, PDFs have some limitations. For one, because such files are traditionally downloaded to a user's desktop computer before they are viewed, and thus live outside the user's web browser, it's hard to build web-based tools to improve the experience of completing the forms they contain. Second, because PDFs are digital representations of real-world paper documents, submitting PDFs forms to agencies often requing printing the document and physically mailing it in.
