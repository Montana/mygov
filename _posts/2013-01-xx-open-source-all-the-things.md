When we first set out to reimagine the relationship between citizens and government, our goal was not simply to build the next generation of citizen-facing tools and services, but also to take a critical look at how those tools and services have been traditionally built. We started by [looking closely 
at at our own process](http://presidential-innovation-fellows.github.com/mygov/2012/12/27/We-believe-Project-MyGov-principles/) and quickly [committed to architechting an open platform](http://presidential-innovation-fellows.github.com/mygov/2013/01/09/building-mygov-open-platform-pt1/) from day one.

Today, MyGov would not be possible if it were not for [countless](http://rubyonrails.org/) [open](http://jekyllrb.com/) [source](http://backbonejs.org/) [projects](http://coffeescript.org/), from our own internal tools, to the very servers that power MyGov itself. For those unfamiliar with the term, [open source software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software) is simply software for which the underlying, human-readable instructions are made publicly available for others to use and submit improvements. Think about it as analagous to the give a penny take a penny tray at your local convenience store, or [asking a neighbor to borrow a screwdriver](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/11/20/open-source-and-power-community).

Open source offers government many advantages: For one, it provides opportunties for cross-agency collaboration that avoids duplication of efforts — after all, many of the challenges faced are common across government. Shared solutions like MyGov allows agencies to concentrate on tackling mission, not solving the same problem time and time again. Likewise, without having to reinvent the wheel each time, agencies can bring services to market faster, cheaper, and often with better quality. Last, open source forces developers not to bake in bespoke solutions or couple interfaces too closely to underlying logic which allows for better modularity and fungability over the liftime of the code, meaning individuals systems can more easily communicate with one another and the initial investment can last longer and be more easily upgraded over time.

At it's core, however, open source is about community, not technology. Today we'd like to take a moment to highlight some of our efforts to give back — to put a penny back in the tray — and more importantly, to add to the ongoing dialog around improving the digital delivery of government services, both with our colleagues at other government agencies, and with the public more broadly. As with all open source software, feel free to adapt the code for your own projects, but with this code in particular, we encourage you to take a moment to improve it by [submitting a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). MyGov began its journey by setting out to improve the experience of interacting with government, but to continue, we need your help. It is our hope that the MyGov projects can serve as an example of citizens and government collaborating to improve their shared experience.
