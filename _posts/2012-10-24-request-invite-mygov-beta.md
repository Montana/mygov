###FAQs

*When will the beta be released?*

We plan on releasing MyGov the week of November 12th.

*How will I know if I'm invited?*

We plan on sending out invitations in waves. So sit tight and if you don't hear from us by the end the November, let us know in the comments and we'll follow up.

*What's being done with my email address?*

We won't spam you, and we won't give it to anyone else. Promise.

*What am I expected to do once the beta is released?*

Once we launch the beta in November, we hope you'll jump in, kick the tires a bit, and provide comments on the blog. We want to know what's working for you and what we can do better. For example, "I like the logo" or "I wish MyGov would tell me when the sun's setting in my town so I can take pictures of it and post them to Instagram."
